<h1>Hey There</h1>
<p>My name is Neil</p>
  <p>I like Pokemon a lot. My favorite Pokemon is Greninja</p>
<p> Review Problems soon to come </p>
  <h1>Pokemon Review Coming Tomorrow (Gen 1 only)</h1>
  <h1>A Pokemon Themed Meme of the Day</h1>

  <h1>A Minor Diversion</h1>
  <p>So, we've been going over complex numbers a lot and before we get into Part 3, I wanted to give you guys</p>
  <p>A fun problem in my favorite area of math</p>
  <h1>Combinatorics!</h1>
  <p>Super Brief Intro: Combinatorics (usually called Combo) is the science of counting. It is very important in Computer Science.</p>
  <p>This problem was given in September (credit to Foyez, Akash, Angelina, and Sadi) (I think Foyez made the problem though)</p>
  <p>How many nine -digit numbers are non decreasing (eg. 112779 is  a non decreasing 6 digit number but 1127379 is not non decreasing b/c 3<7)</p>
  <p>Topics you might need to know to solve it</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Recursion</li>
  <li>Pascal's Triangle</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Hints</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Idiot Test: You're solution should not be greater than the number of nine digit numbers (900,000,000)</li>
    <li>Use Cases: Think about when the number starts with a one, or a two, all the way through nine</li>
    <li>Look at one digit and two digit examples (Make sure to save and organize your data)</li>
    <li>Finally, and I cannot stress this point enough: FOR COMBINATORIAL PROBLEMS, RELATE IT TO SOMETHING YOU KNOW.
      For example, if you like ice cream a lot, try to think of the problem in terms of ice cream (you might want to think of 
      this problem just in terms of numbers though. But think about it in any way you like. This is more of a general thing)</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Complex plane part 2</h1>
  <p>So by now, you guys have probably realized that if w = (r1,alpha) (r1 is dist. from origin and alpha is angle formed with x-axis)</p>
  <p> And z = (r2,beta)</p>
  <p>Then w*z = (r1*r2,alpha+beta)</p>
  <p>So I want you guys to come up with an equation for finding cos(10 deg). It will be a little challenging and if you want to solve</p>
  <p>For your equation w/o a calculator then you'll probably need Cardano's method</p>
  <p>If the equation you get is 4x^3-3x-sqrt(3)/2= 0 where x= cos 10 deg or some equivalent equation, then you are on the right track</p>
  <p>That's all for today</p>
  <h1> Hey Guys, so yesterday's post really blew up so I'm not gonna delete it like I usually do</h1>
  <h2>Anyways, I promised a solution</h2>
  <p>This problem is actually the 2007 Problem 1 of the Balkan Math Olympiad so don't feel bad if you couldn't solve it.</p>
  <p>Here's a solution which I really like</p>
  <p>Since AB = BC, angle BAC = angle ACB, and similarly, angle CBD = angle BDC. Since angle CEB = angle AED, by considering triangles CEB, AED we have angle BAC + angle BDC = angle ECB + angle CBE = angle EAD + angle EDA.
    It follows that 2 ( angle BAC + angle BDC ) = angle BAD + angle ADC.

By the Law of Sines,

AE/DE = AE/EB*EB/EC*EC/DE = 
    sin (pi - 2a - b)/sin(a) * sin(a)/sin(b) * sin(b)/sin (pi - 2b - a)} = sin (pi - 2a - b)/sin (pi - 2b - a).

It follows that AE = DE if and only if

sin (pi - 2a - b) = sin (pi - 2b - a).

Since 0 < a, b < pi/2,

0 < (pi - 2a - b) + (pi - 2b - a) < 2pi,
and

-pi < (pi - 2a - b) - (pi - 2b - a) < pi.
From these inequalities, we see that sin (pi - 2a - b ) = sin (pi - 2b - a) if and only if (pi - 2a - b) = (pi - 2b - a)
    (i.e., a = b) or (pi - 2a - b) + (pi - 2b - a) = pi (i.e., 3(a + b) = pi). 
    But if a = b, then triangles ABC, BCD are congruent and AC = BD, a contradiction.
    Thus we conclude that AE = DE if and only if a + b = pi/3, Q.E.D.</p>

  <h1>Topic of the Day: Angle addition using the Complex plane</h1>
  <h3>Disclaimer: While this way may look super hard once you understand what I'm doing sin(a+b) and cos(a+b) will be a piece of cake.</h3>
  <p>I'm gonna break this topic into a bunch of small parts. First, lets talk about complex numbers. So lets say we have complex numbers w and z</p>
  <p>On a graph, we can represent w and z by their distance to the origin and the angle they form with the x - axis</p>
  <p>This is called polar form so instead of giving coors (x,y), we give (r, theta)</p>
  <p>I want you guys to experiment with different w's and z's and find the angle of w, the angle of z, and the angle of w*z</p>
  <p> more to come tomorrow</p>

  <h1>Topic of the Day: Law of Sines</h1>
  <h2>You should probably already know what law of sines is so here is an easy law of sines problem</h2>
  <p>Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with AB=BC=CD, AC ≠ BD, and let E be the intersection point of its diagonals. Prove that AE=DE if and only if angle BAD+angle ADC = 120 degrees.</p>
