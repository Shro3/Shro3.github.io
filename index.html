<h1>Hey There</h1>
<p>My name is Neil</p>
  <p>I like Pokemon a lot. My favorite Pokemon is Greninja</p>
<p> Review Problems soon to come </p>
  <h1> Hey Guys, so yesterday's post really blew up so I'm not gonna delete it like I usually do</h1>
  <h2>Anyways, I promised a solution</h2>
  <p>This problem is actually the 2007 Problem 1 of the Balkan Math Olympiad so don't feel bad if you couldn't solve it.</p>
  <p>Here's a solution which I really like</p>
  <p>Since AB = BC, angle BAC = angle ACB, and similarly, angle CBD = angle BDC. Since angle CEB = angle AED, by considering triangles CEB, AED we have angle BAC + angle BDC = angle ECB + angle CBE = angle EAD + angle EDA.
    It follows that 2 ( angle BAC + angle BDC ) = angle BAD + angle ADC.

By the Law of Sines,

AE/DE = AE/EB*EB/EC*EC/DE = 
    sin (pi - 2a - b)/sin(a) * sin(a)/sin(b) * sin(b)/sin (pi - 2b - a)} = sin (pi - 2a - b)/sin (pi - 2b - a).

It follows that AE = DE if and only if

sin (pi - 2a - b) = sin (pi - 2b - a).

Since 0 < a, b < pi/2,

0 < (pi - 2a - b) + (pi - 2b - a) < 2pi,
and

-pi < (pi - 2a - b) - (pi - 2b - a) < pi.
From these inequalities, we see that sin (pi - 2a - b ) = sin (pi - 2b - a) if and only if (pi - 2a - b) = (pi - 2b - a)
    (i.e., a = b) or (pi - 2a - b) + (pi - 2b - a) = pi (i.e., 3(a + b) = pi). 
    But if a = b, then triangles ABC, BCD are congruent and AC = BD, a contradiction.
    Thus we conclude that AE = DE if and only if a + b = pi/3, Q.E.D.</p>

  <h1>Topic of the Day: Angle addition using the Complex plane</h1>
  <h3>Disclaimer: While this way may look super hard once you understand what I'm doing sin(a+b) and cos(a+b) will be a piece of cake.</h3>
  <p>I'm gonna break this topic into a bunch of small parts. First, lets talk about complex numbers. So lets say we have complex numbers w and z</p>
  <p>On a graph, we can represent w and z by their distance to the origin and the angle they form with the x - axis</p>
  <p>This is called polar form so instead of giving coors (x,y), we give (r, theta)</p>
  <p>I want you guys to experiment with different w's and z's and find the angle of w, the angle of z, and the angle of w*z</p>
  <p> more to come tomorrow</p>

  <h1>Topic of the Day: Law of Sines</h1>
  <h2>You should probably already know what law of sines is so here is an easy law of sines problem</h2>
  <p>Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with AB=BC=CD, AC ≠ BD, and let E be the intersection point of its diagonals. Prove that AE=DE if and only if angle BAD+angle ADC = 120 degrees.</p>
  <h3>Solution coming tmrw</h3>
